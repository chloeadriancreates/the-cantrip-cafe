# 🪄 The Cantrip Café

**A searchable spellbook for Dungeons & Dragons 5e, designed and developed from scratch with Next.js, TypeScript, and Sass.**  
Created in 2025 as a personal project to blend usability, design, and a bit of magic.

## 🌟 Overview
The Cantrip Café is a web app for Dungeons & Dragons 5e players who want an elegant, intuitive way to browse spells during their campaigns.  

It lets users **search, filter, and view detailed spell information** through a clean, responsive interface built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Sass**.  
Each spell card displays all relevant stats at a glance, and filters make it easy to find the perfect spell by name, school, or level.

This project combines my passion for **accessibility and user-centered design** with my love for world-building, fantasy, and front-end craftsmanship.
